Created DB2GeometryEquality to handle DB2 specifics, to avoid the MCoordinates test as the retrieved data uses Coordinates
in the geometry.

Modified GeometryEquality to create/use testSRID method that can be overridden

EWKTReader doesn't work with the test data for Z or M data. It tests for 'POINTM' but the data is 'POINT M'.

TestSpatialFunctions failures:
transform:
DB2 transform functions between spatial reference systems with the same datum but not different datums.
This causes the transform test in TestSpatialFunctions to fail because it transforms from WGS84 to WGS_1972_Transit_Broadcast_Ephemeris

Testing with PostGIS
Insert statements failed error GeomFromText is unknown function. Had to change PosgisExpressionTemplate to use st_GeometryFromText instead.
